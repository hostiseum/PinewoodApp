##This Repo contains the following projects
1. PinewoodApp.CustomerAPI - Contains API
2. PinewoodApp.CustomerAPI.Tests
3. PinewoodApp.CustomerDMS

Database is in-memory so when the API is run the data is added via seed.json file that can be found in Data folder.
To access customer portal you can either go via Top navigation or the button that is presented on the Home page.

API is written using CQRS pattern. 

I have also added Sample Unit tests for CustomerRepository.cs

Hope you find my solution interesting. 

Thanks
Kalyana
